### Project Title:
If Cats Could Drive — A Whimsical Web Experience

**Project Overview:**

Ever wonder what kind of cars cats would drive if they could get behind the wheel? This playful web project explores that fun, imaginative scenario. The site allows users to design custom "cat-mobiles," complete with feline-inspired features and quirky accessories. Whether it's a cat ear convertible or just an old classic sedan purring away when started, this project is all about letting creativity run wild. Along the way, it serves as an engaging platform to practice front-end design, user interaction, and backend data handling.

**Important Features:**

1. Car Customizer: Users can mix and match various car models, colors, and cat-themed modifications (e.g. tails, whisker decals, paw-shaped headlights).
2. Interact with your 3D models: an easy-to-use 3D viewer to rotate, zoom, and view their cat-mobiles from all sides.
3. Saved Creations & Profiles: Users can save their designs, sign up, and show off their collections in a gallery.
4. Community Voting: "cat-approval rating" - other users will be able to upvote or comment on the designs.
5. Fun Animations & Sound Effects: purrs, meows, and other sweet sounds of cats will make it more fun to create.

**Tech Stack:**

• Frontend:
- React (for building the user interface, state management with hooks or Redux)
- Three.js or React Three Fiber (for the 3D car model viewing and interactions)
- CSS/Sass/Tailwind (for styling and responsive design)

Backend:
- Node.js with Express (for RESTful APIs and user authentication)
- MongoDB (for storing user profiles, designs, and community votes)
- Cloud Hosting (Heroku, AWS, or similar to deploy the application and database)

**Why This Project:**
- Fun & Unique Concept: It is a creative concept that encourages creativity and makes learning fun.
- Skill Development: The development of a custom car designer requires a combination of front-end design, real-time 3D rendering, and robust backend data management.
- Community Engagement: User profiles, social sharing, and voting features help in understanding user-based app development and backend integrations.
- Portfolio Enhancement: A lively, interactive project stands out, demonstrating mastery of modern web technologies and a flair for innovative design.
